This category is used for faction map battles, when a battle occurs it will be added here for faction leaders to discuss terms and to organise battles.
Battles in faction map have pre-set terms to reduce the complexity of  battles & terms

## Battle Rules
- Only commanders & Mediators may use global chat, only exception being at the end of the round. (soldiers use /team whilst chatting)
- Only may the Mediator present the score, this is to prevent confusion.
- Mediators have the ability to decide when a round starts.
- Mediators have the ability to cancel a round due to cheating.
- Mediators must have access to admin commands on the private server where the battle is hosted.
- Battles are first to 5
- Failing to comply with a mediator is an instant defeat.

## Pre-set terms

Server: Mediators own
Rally size: determined by `/team` total sizes
Mercs/ Duel Enlisters: ❌
Pause time: ✅

Time: Discussed and chosen by mediator to best accommodate everyone
Server: Discussed and chosen by mediator to best accommodate everyone

Tier One:
- Sappers
- Archers
- Light Infantry

Tier Two:

During a siege, the attacking faction has a 10-minute grace period before attrition starts affecting the battle. Once the 10 minutes have passed, the defending side gains 1 point for every additional 2 minutes that elapse.

Here's how the scoring works:

At 12 minutes: 1 point for defenders (0-1)
At 14 minutes: 2 points for defenders (0-2)
At 16 minutes: 3 points for defenders (0-3)
At 18 minutes: 4 points for defenders (0-4)
At 20 minutes: 5 points for defenders (0-5)
The attackers can only win by capturing the final objective, which grants them a score of 5. The final score reflects the number of points the defenders earned before the attackers captured the objective.

For example, if the attackers capture the objective at the 14-minute mark, the final score would be 5-2.

Battle of thermoplyae-Defending team goes hellenic due to the camp and nature of the battle, while attackers are persian

Siege of Orleans-France are the agressors and England are the defenders (duh)

Battle Of The Herrings-England is defending due to the fact of how much larger their camp is, while the french one is mostly tents and a single barricaded wall.

Battle Of Milvian Bridge- Defenders are Maxentenius due to the fact that during the battle AND ingame maxetenius held the bridge

Battle of Agincourt- England defends due to their stake wall, this can be changed in individual battle terms due to the nature of cavalry
