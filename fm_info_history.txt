[2024-10-15 18:12:54] thewolf3152: ## Turn system

Turns in faction map is how often the you can interact with units & regions again after interacting with them. Every so often a turn occurs, This time will be listed below.

Current turn cycle: `3 Hours`

## Dynamic turns

Armies have dynamic turning for marching, This means that smaller armies have less of a cooldown before they can be used again.

E.g Armies consisting of 1 Troop only have a cooldown of an hour, whereas armies of 50 troops will have a 3 Hour cooldown

Cooldown formula for nerds
```py
totalSize = deployment.tierOne + deployment.tierTwo
modifier = 600
totalSize *= modifier
totalSize = min(max(totalSize),10800,3600)
```
